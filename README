An assignment for our Compute Systems Module. It involved us learning and coding in ubuntu. Our assignment involved us 
creating a Customer Details contact book which held the customer's email, name, address and phone number.
The assignment specified various abilities the user could do:

1: Add a new Customer
2: Remove a Customer
3: Search for a Customer
4: Email a Customer

This script allows you to do all the above as well as emailing and deleting multiple customers as once

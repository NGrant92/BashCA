Since our discussion on thursday 27th april I've:

- Changed the search methods so if will allow the user to delete or email
  multiple people at once

- Changed the email script so it will allow the user to email everyone
  in their contact list if the user inputs "all" when asked

- In AddCust I added text that will ask the user to "Please try again"
  if they input a name, email or phone number incorrectly
